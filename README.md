IMPLEMENTATION OF CNN AND APPLICATION OF CNN MODULES FROM PYTORCH

Data: images from 10 different classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)\\
      Train set split into train set and validation set (8:2)
My implementation: Convolution2D, Dropout, BatchNorm2D, cross entropy loss, SGD optimizer)
CNN: 3 full blocks(Convolution2D, batch normalization 2D, relu, maxpool), classifier, relu, dropout, fc layer
